# 🌦️ Weather Forecast App

  Ever stood outside trying to guess if the sky is just moody or about to drench you? Now, you won’t have to. This Weather Forecast 
App tells you exactly what’s going on up there—sunshine, clouds, wind or wrath of the rain gods.

---

## 🌐 Overview

  This is a clean, beginner-friendly weather web app built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—no frameworks, no libraries.
It fetches live weather data and displays it in a clean UI that adapts across screens.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – Custom styling with gradients and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation and API integration  
- **No frameworks or external libraries used**

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Search by City** – Enter any city and get weather details  
- 🌤️ **Current Weather** – Temperature, condition, feels-like temperature  
- 🕒 **Hourly Forecast** – Weather for each 3-hour block  
- 📆 **Weekly Forecast** – 3-day forecast at a glance  
- 💨 **Wind & Humidity** – Real-time atmospheric data

## 🚧 Room for Development

While the app works well, there are a few areas for improvement:

- 🔤 **Input Validation**: Misspelled or invalid city names result in broken data or no response. A more graceful error handling mechanism could be added.
- 💾 **No Local Storage**: The app doesn’t remember your previously searched cities.
- 🧱 **Simple Design**: While intentionally minimalistic, the design can be enhanced with animations, icons, or dark mode support.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project taught me how to:

- Work with **public APIs**, particularly weather-based ones
- Parse JSON data effectively
- Integrate APIs with frontend JavaScript
- Dynamically update the DOM with user-input-based data

The "aha!" moment was realizing how powerful simple JavaScript can be when working with real-time APIs.

## 🧾 Conclusion

  This project was a deep dive into connecting front-end interfaces with real-time data. It's a great starter project for anyone looking to 
learn how APIs work and how to present data dynamically on a web page. I'm proud of what I built and excited about where I can take it next.
